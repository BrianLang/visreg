      *  Added 'trans' option for transforming response variable,
          axes still need changing when option is used, the centerFrame
          function is causing a problem when a transformed variable is
          used in the model
      ** Changed internal data frame evaluation, allowing the ability
          to lookup variables in the original data frame when
          constructing derived variables
          NOTE: Doing so rendered fillX obsolete and resulted in
                substantial changes to fillFrame, centerFrame, and
                setupD
          NOTE: This issue still causes an error if the variable is
                located in the global environment instead of the data
                frame; I see no easy way to resolve this error.

      *  Added fill='median' option

0.0-1 
      ** Added 'type' option to visreg, allowing both conditional and
          term plots
      *  Changed default y label in visreg
      *  Added fill='zero' option

      *** Package infrastructure established
      **  visreg.R, visreg2d.R: Polynomial terms handled correctly
